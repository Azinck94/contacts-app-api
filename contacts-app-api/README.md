## Introduction


 This is the backend API I created for the Solstice coding challenge! The prompt asked for a backend API that developers could use to connect with a front-end interface in order to manage their contact list. This was a fun project although my approach was a little hectic as I am currently taking finals exams this week and next. It was a great exercise and allowed me to dive into the documentation for Mongoose, MongoDB and Heroku.

## Wireframes

-  A user wants to add a contact to the list.
-  A user wants to update a contact on the list.
-  A user wants to remove a contact from the list.
-  A user wants to retrieve a contact from the list.
-  A contact should have basic information fields.
-  A user should be able to search for a contact by email or phone

## Development Process

  I initially began this project by diving into the documentation for a mongoose, express and focusing on incorporating CRUD function for a MVP.


## Unsolved Problems
Due to major time constraints during finals week I was dissapointed that I was unable to incorporate elements necessary for uploading profile images for contacts nor was I able to allow for a search function based on number or email. Apologies in advance for that but at the very least I have begun to dive into stackoverflow for ways in which I might be able to do so in the future.

## Takeways
I had a blast working on a new project and was happy to get more coding experience. Thank you for the consideration!
